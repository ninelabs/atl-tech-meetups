It's a great way to meet new people and socialize with your fellow brainiacs.

There's so much going on in this city.

Join this group if:

You like learning things, going to museums, science lectures, and you can't get your regular crew to go with you.

Perhaps you went to engineering school, but you use hair conditioner anyway.

You're intelligent and you have social skills, even though you might have a video game or two (or three) on your hard drive.

If you're willing to let your geek flag fly, please join us. Event suggestions encouraged.

And, if there's something you want to go to that our organizers can't make, we can post the event anyway to rally the Nerd Herd to keep you company. Just let us know.

Welcome.

Hair conditioner optional.

The Nerd Fun Creed:

* Nerds RSVP ""yes"" only when they're sure they can show - 'cuz Nerds are wicked smart and are able to plan ahead reliably - Nerds don't let their fellow nerds down.
* Nerds also know how to set up email filters so they can handle the quantity of email that meetup produces. ;-)
* And lastly, organizers have the right to disallow you from coming to an event if they can't see a photo of you on your profile page.

Do you consider yourself a ""NERD"".

The Urban Dictionary (http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?t... (http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Nerd))

defines Nerd as:

1. One whose IQ exceeds his weight.

2. An individual persecuted for his superior skills or intellect, most often by people who fear and envy him.

3. An 'individual', i.e. a person who does not conform to society's beliefs that all people should follow trends and do what their peers do. Often highly intelligent but socially rejected because of their obsession with a given subject, technology, fandom, cosplay, sci-fi/fantasy.

""Nerds are clearly superior to us in every way.. Let's worship them as our Gods""",2250

Every time you do a Google search, you are using a trained deep learning model. Google CEO Sundar Pichai recently asserted that if the last decade was about ‘mobile-first’, then the next decade will be about ‘AI-first’. Within the larger artificial intelligence and machine learning domains, ‘deep learning’ is where many of the most significant innovations are occurring - self-driving cars, self-organizing drone swarms, computer vision, conversational interfaces, gene editing, emotion recognition, etc.,

Deep learning will impact nearly every industry on the planet, and there will be countless opportunities to take advantage of this technology. While most people who are aware of deep learning think of it as the domain of data scientists and mathematicians, it takes skilled software engineers to implement deep learning models as practical software in real-world systems.

3. business-oriented topics like cloud economic and pricing models, cloud migration strategies, legal and compliance implications of the cloud, etc.

Below You'll find some testimonials and a free webinar to get a sense of how we teach. Hopefully you find enough value to decide to join our group. We look forward to meeting you in person soon!

Here's a testimonial from a GA Tech professional that has received his breakthrough after participating in the training:

""It is with the greatest pleasure that l write this recommendation to Mr. Ariel Ghinga, CEO of the Personality Development Group, LLC. I came across an advertisement by Ariel when I was searching for expert advice and coaching to improve my professional and personal presentation and overall expression skills. The service provided by Ariel via one-on-one coaching sessions proved to be more than the monies’ worth. Ariel’s training, guidance and teaching caused a signiﬁcant transformation in my life. His methods helped me achieve much more than I expected: I was able to achieve my immediate career goals by implementing his approaches in real life situations.

By just showing up for one of his demonstrations sessions, I was able to gauge what to expect and immediately signed up for his services. That was one of the smartest decisions I made in my life. I would highly recommend Ariel’s services to anyone who is looking to achieve his or her dream goals but is only restricted by the weaknesses or negative aspects of the personality. If you think you have some difficulties in expressing yourself or surviving under professional or normal social settings, Ariel would be the person to go for! He will guide you towards your goals, and teach you methods that will continuously keep you on track for nothing less than the ultimate success of your personal goals!"" – Chaminda M. Gamage, Ph.D., Research Scientist II, School of Chemistry and Biochemistry Georgia Institute of Technology

Mattia Harris Bolton (http://www.meetup.com/Atlanta-Public-Speaking/members/182966684/)

The workshop was powerful and effective. I came away with so much more insight than I previously had in the area of public speaking. Ariel has this way of making learning fun, so while I was gaining an understanding of how to use my tone of voice, hand gestures and attitude to grasp the crowd, I was yet having a ball. He has a natural way of making you feel comfortable in his presence and okay with making a few mistakes without feeling like an idiot. I absolutely loved this workshop and look forward to working with him in the near future to assist me in perfecting my speaking craft. Ariel has an awesome gift of teaching. He is a natural motivator and he has instilled a lot within me in just those 2 hours, Ariel is a gift.

Hey Ariel! I didn't know you're doing Pub Speaking MeetUps man!! I wish I would've known sooner. I can't make it to the 12/12 gig because I'm doing dinner with a buddy who saved my life when my head blew up from the Anneurysm. (You remember Riad right??) But, PLEASE if you're open/willing, let me know about your next Public Speaking event so I can make SURE to book it before anything else! I'm DEFINITELY wanting to get back into doing more speaking again. So, that would be AWESOME!!
(I just never know when my memory will work or when it won't from the Anneurysm. So, in case I don't find/see the notification about it I'm hoping you'll send me an email/text.)
Thx for being such a Rock Star, my friend!

Or, looking to learn more about professional WordPress development and best practices, and not afraid to dig into the code?

Wish there was a place to go, close to home, where you know you can get WordPress help and guidance from people who know WordPress inside-and-out but allow you to feel comfortable asking any question?

Get solid, knowledgeable WordPress help and discussion from people who help build WordPress itself — right here in Gwinnett.

Every 3rd Thursday of the month starting at 7:00pm.

From just starting out with WordPress (where the heck is my dashboard again?) to professional WordPress development and deployments, you'll find something to fit where you are on your WordPress journey — without having to drive downtown!

You won't be on the receiving end of any sales pitches, but, you will have access to a strong core of WordPress developers (who work with WordPress users for a living) who will be able to guide you to the *best* ways to do whatever you can dream of (and will legitimately tell you when we just don't know :-)).

So come on by — all you need is your own WordPress site and a desire to learn.

Our general users meet up from 7:00 - 7:45pm and developers (and advanced users* who want to learn more) from 7:45 - 8:30pm (you can come to both if you want!)

A quick overview
There are several online machine learning courses offered right now, Coursera (http://www.coursera.com/), Udacity (http://www.udacity.com/), Caltech (http://work.caltech.edu/library), Stanford (http://scpd.stanford.edu/public/category/courseCategoryCertificateProfile.do?method=load&from=courseprofile&certificateId=10555807). This course is based on the “learning by example” principle. The students will be introduced in machine learning algorithms and data analysis techniques by actively working on a real dataset.

Course style
In this course we will not follow the traditional lecturing style with powerpoint style. It will be taught in lab sessions. We will have an one hour session every week. The instructor will present an algorithm along with a dataset. The students will use the language of their preference to code the algorithm and then apply it to the dataset.

Tools, hardware
The preferred language is python along with the http://www.mortardata.com platform.

Frequently Asked Questions

Which day of the week will the course take place? Most likely every Friday 4pm to 6pm
When does the course begin? November 9th
Where do you meet every week? The course will take place in the LogicBlox office
